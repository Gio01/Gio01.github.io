            <div> 
                Currently, an InfoSec student studying at Purdue University. Before my current enrollment, 
                I was studying Computer Science at DePauw University where I took interest in Web Development. 
                Specifically, I did some Full Stack Web Development with Javascript.

                During my last year at DePauw, I published my thesis "Cyber Security in the Healthcare Industry" 
                where I researched the many vectors of attack that exist within hospital settings. This included 
                topics such as Medical Devices, Social Engineering, and Networking. From the research I had done 
                on this thesis I decided that I wanted to learn more about security and hence I decided to pursue 
                my current Master's in Information Security to learn more about security. From my experience, there 
                is a gap between the development of software for functionality and the development of software with 
                security in mind. I want to bridge this gap to help make software both secure and functional for users
                to use safely.

                Currently I am studying Reverse Engineering. Specifically on C/C++ programs. I am starting to also
                compete in CTF competitions, studying pentesting, and studying to take the CompTIA Security+ SY0-601
                Certification Exam. I am rather new to the field so there is a lot to learn.
